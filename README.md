## Editing Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses the [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/basics/usage-with-react) library.
>`create-react-app` comes with certain dependencies, but more will need to be added before the project will compile.


>`redux` is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications and is the most popular State container that is used for React applications. 

To successfully launch this application, the following must be entered into the terminal:

1. `git clone` into the proper directory, and then `cd` into the `frontend` folder.

2. `yarn install` to install dependencies.

3. `yarn add redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-logger axios react-router-dom cryptr less` will add the necessary dependencies to run this application.

4. `yarn start` will run the application in development mode, and the webpage should be located at http://localhost:3000 in the browser. Happy coding!
